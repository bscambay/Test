Good Morning Joseph, do you have few minutes to talk.
Sure
Just a quick question, were you able to get our slackclone configured and running here in office ?
I had an issue with SQL lite
Paul was able to 
I an also not able to get SQlite .. do you have the latest code ?  if yes can you share in folder for just 5 minutes ?  I will copy it on my PC .
give me a moment
where is the folder
sure take your time... when ready please let me know.
I have the folder 
I just need the location
I can share folder from my PC and send you link.
So which is the folder?
Please try to copy in following folder.
D:\Bhavin 
\\S16103D\Bhavin
are you able to open folder ?
no 
I have another folder
give me a moment
Please try again , I have shared it with you now.
Should be done
Thank you, I saw that project has been copied over, another question is do you had to set anything in Environment variable ? just want to verify with you and compare mine .
Yes
I added D:\NodeJS\node-v6.5.0-win-x86 
to the path 
that is where my Node JS is found 
any proxy settings ?
yes 
can you please share with me ?
I'm looking
proxy = "__http://access.lb.ssa.gov:80/"
https-proxy = "__https://access.lb.ssa.gov:80/"
strict-ssl = false
This was added in user variables or System variables ?
npm config
and what was the variable name and value ? for node also you added in path variable?
npm config set proxy __http://access.lb.ssa.gov:80/
npm config set https-proxy = __https://access.lb.ssa.gov:80/
there should be no equal sign 
npm config set https-proxy __https://access.lb.ssa.gov:80/ 
npm config set strict-ssl false
  node variable was set in path ? D:\NodeJS\node-v6.5.0-win-x86 this was added in PATH variable ? 
yes
Thank you very much for your help , I will do it again as you have mentioned, I had added yesterday npm commands directly in my environment variable and it did work for while but once rebooted PC they were all gone.
